# puppeteer_resource_load_times

A node script that uses Puppeteers interaction with the Chrome Performance analyser to monitor specific requests. 

I have it set up to do 5 requests and log out the indivdual Response End Time, as well as the average for each request I specify (I'm using svg assets on testautimation university as an example).

Essentially just a proof of concept at the moment, would need more work to make it robust enough for general use.
